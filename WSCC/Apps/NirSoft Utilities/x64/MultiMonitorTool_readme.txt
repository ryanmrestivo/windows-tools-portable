Description
===========

MultiMonitorTool is a small tool that allows you to do some actions
related to working with multiple monitors. With MultiMonitorTool, you can
disable/enable monitors, set the primary monitor, save and load the
configuration of all monitors, and move windows from one monitor to
another. You can do these actions from the user interface or from
command-line, without displaying user interface. MultiMonitorTool also
provides a preview window, which allows you to watch a preview of every
monitor on your system.



System Requirements and Limitations
===================================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  XP and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and x64 systems are supported.
* When you disable a monitor on a system with 3 monitors or more, and
  then later enable back the monitor, the operating system may put the
  monitor in another position. In order to avoid this problem, use the
  'Save Monitors Configuration' option to save your monitors
  configuration into a file and then load it later using the 'Load
  Monitors Configuration' option.
* This utility is only useful if your desktop is extended to multiple
  monitors. If you have multiple monitors that display the same content,
  then MultiMonitorTool is useless for you.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.96
  o When trying to enable a monitor from command-line ( /enable
    command) using the monitor number (e.g: /enable 2 or /enable
    \\.\DISPLAY1 ), MultiMonitorTool now tries to enable the monitor even
    if it cannot be found in the monitors list.

* Version 1.95
  o When disabling and then enabling a monitor on a system with 3
    monitors or more, MultiMonitorTool tries to put it back in the
    original position. Currently, this feature works only when you do the
    disable and enable without exit from MultiMonitorTool and it doesn't
    work from command-line.
  o The 'Use Monitor ID In Load Config' option is now turned on by
    default.

* Version 1.92
  o Fixed bug: When using the /PreviewOnly command-line option,
    MultiMonitorTool ignored the current value of preview update rate
    ('Advanced Options' window).

* Version 1.91
  o You can now use the serial number of the monitor ('Monitor Serial
    Number' column) in all command-line options.

* Version 1.90
  o Added new options: 'Turn Off Monitors', 'Turn On Monitors', and
    'Switch Off/On Monitors'. These options works only on Windows Vista
    or later with hardware that supports DDC/CI.
  o Added new command-line options: /TurnOff , /TurnOn , and
    /SwitchOffOn

* Version 1.86
  o 'Use Monitor ID In Load Config' option is now turned on by
    default.

* Version 1.85
  o When making changes from command-line ( /enable, /disable, and so
    on...) MultiMonitorTool now loads all monitors to the internal list
    that is used to delect the specified monitor, including monitors
    detected as 'Duplicate' and 'Disconnected'. In previous versions,
    MultiMonitorTool failed to find the monitor if it was detected as
    Duplicate/Disconnected.
  o Made a small change that hopefully will fix incorrect MonitorID
    problem on some systems.
  o When duplicate monitors are detected and 'Show Duplicate
    Monitors' is turned off, MultiMonitorTool now takes the first monitor
    item instead of the second one.
  o Added 'Disconnected' column.

* Version 1.83
  o Added 'Show Duplicate Monitors' option. On version 1.80, a bug
    that caused MultiMonitorTool to display the same monitor more than
    once was fixed, but it seems that on some systems, this bug fix may
    cause MultiMonitorTool to ignore a second monitor. So if you don't
    see all monitors on your system, you should try to turn on the 'Show
    Duplicate Monitors' option...

* Version 1.82
  o You can now specify the Monitor ID value in all command-line
    options (/disable, /enable, /switch, and so on), for example:
    MultiMonitorTool.exe /enable
    "MONITOR\GSM59A4\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0012"

* Version 1.81
  o Added 'Show Disconnected Monitors' option.

* Version 1.80
  o Fixed bug: In some monitor configurations, MultiMonitorTool
    displayed the same monitor more than once.
  o The monitor ID of every monitor is now saved into the monitors
    configuration file.
  o Added 'Use Monitor ID In Load Config' option, If you turn it on,
    MultiMonitorTool will use the monitor ID to detect the correct
    monitors when you load a monitors configuration file.

* Version 1.75
  o Added new columns: Monitor ID, Monitor Key, Monitor String,
    Monitor Name, Monitor Serial Number. (The values of 'Monitor Name'
    and 'Monitor Serial Number' columns are taken from the EDID data of
    the monitor)
  o Fixed bug: The Left-Top column displayed the coodinates as
    top-left instead of left-top.

* Version 1.72
  o Fixed bug: MultiMonitorTool failed to remember the last
    size/position of the main window and the monitor preview window if
    they were not located in the primary monitor.

* Version 1.71:
  o Fixed MultiMonitorTool to avoid from moving to another monitor
    the secondary taskbar (Shell_SecondaryTrayWnd class) of Windows 8.

* Version 1.70:
  o Added option to set the update rate of the monitor preview window
    (the default rate is 1000 milliseconds) in the Advanced Options

    adapter, you can set update rate to around 50 milliseconds and get a
    real-time view of another monitor.

  o Added option to change the display orientation, from the user
    interface and from command-line ( /SetOrientation ).

* Version 1.55:
  o Added 'Sort On Every Update' option. If it's turned on,
    MultiMonitorTool will sort the list of monitors and the list of
    Windows, every time that there is a change.

* Version 1.51:
  o Added 'Clear Recent Files List' option.

* Version 1.50:
  o You can now choose to load the most recent 5 monitor
    configurations from the tray menu.

    the main window.

* Version 1.32:

    monitor. MultiMonitorTool also failed to move these windows with
    /MoveWindow command-line option.

    monitor that you selected in the previous time you used
    MultiMonitorTool.

MultiMonitorTool doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
MultiMonitorTool.exe

The main window of MultiMonitorTool contains 2 panes: The upper pane
displays the list of all monitors detected on your system. When you
select a monitor in the upper pane, the lower pane displays the details
of all visible windows on the selected monitor.

You can select one or more monitors in the upper pane, and then use the
following options: Disable Selected Monitors (Ctrl+F6), Enable Selected
Monitors (Ctrl+F7), Disable/Enable Switch (Ctrl+F8), or Set As Primary
Monitor (Ctrl+F9)

Translating MultiMonitorTool to other languages
===============================================

In order to translate MultiMonitorTool to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run MultiMonitorTool with /savelangfile parameter:
   MultiMonitorTool.exe /savelangfile
   A file named MultiMonitorTool_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   MultiMonitorTool utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run MultiMonitorTool, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run MultiMonitorTool without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
