Description
===========

HashMyFiles is small utility that allows you to calculate the hashes
(MD5, SHA1, CRC32, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-384) of one or more files in
your system. You can easily copy the hashes list into the clipboard, or
save them into text/html/xml file.
HashMyFiles can also be launched from the context menu of Windows
Explorer, and display the hashes of the selected file or folder.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works on Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/Windows 7/Windows
8/Windows 10/Windows 11. Older versions of Windows are not supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 2.50:
  o Added 'Live Hashes Display' option. When it's turned on,
    HashMyFiles displays the hashes of every file immediately after they
    are calculated, instead of waiting until all files are processed.
  o Added new columns: 'Hash Start Time', 'Hash End Time', 'Hashing
    Duration'.

* Version 2.44:
  o You can now send the hash data to stdout by specifying empty
    string as filename, for example:
    HashMyFiles.exe /File "C:\Temp\*.*" /scomma "" | more

* Version 2.43:
  o Added /cfg command-line option to start HashMyFiles with the
    specified config file.

* Version 2.42:
  o Added 'Drag & Drop / Explorer Paste Folder Mode' option, which
    controls how folder is added when dragging a folder from Windows
    Explorer or pasting a folder from Windows Explorer.
  o There are 2 option to choose: 'Add only files from the base
    folder' (The default option) or 'Add files from the base folder and
    all its subfolders'.
  o Added option to change the sorting column from the menu (View ->
    Sort By). Like the column header click sorting, if you click again
    the same sorting menu item, it'll switch between ascending and
    descending order.

Using HashMyFiles
=================

HashMyFiles doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file
(HashMyFiles.exe).
After you run it, you can add files and folders that you want to view
their MD5/SHA1 hashes. You can do it by using the 'Add File' and 'Add
Folder' options under the File menu, or simply by draging the files and
folder from Explorer into the main window of HashMyFiles.
After adding the desired files, you can copy the MD5/SHA1 hashes to the
clipboard, or save the hashes list into text/html/xml file.



Explorer Context Menu
=====================

HashMyFiles can also be used directly from Windows Explorer. In order to
enable this feature, go to the Options menu, and choose the 'Enable
Explorer Context Menu' option. After you enable this feature, you can
right-click on any file or folder on Windows Explorer, and choose the
'HashMyFiles' item from the menu.
If you run the HashMyFiles option for a folder, it'll display the hashes
for all files in the selected folder.
If you run the HashMyFiles option for a single file, it'll display only
the hashes for that file.

Notice: Static menu items of Explorer may not work well with multiple
files. If you use the HashMyFiles context menu with multiple files, it's
possible that multiple instances of HashMyFiles will be opened.
If you want to get the hash of multiple files from Explorer window, use
Copy & Explorer Paste, or drag the files into the HashMyFiles window.




Command-Line Options
====================



/file <Filename | Folder | Wildcard>
Specifies the filename, folder, or wildcard that you want to hash.

/files <Filename> <Filename> <Filename> ...
Specify multiple filenames, folders, or wildcards that you want to hash.

/folder <Folder>
Specifies a folder and all its subfolders.

/wildcard <Full Path Wildcard> <Subfolder Depth>
Specifies wildcard with full path (e.g: c:\folder\*.exe) and the depth of
subfolders to scan. For <Subfolder Depth> parameter: 0 = no subfolders, 1
= one level of subfolders, 2 = two level of subfolders, and so on... 1000
= Infinite number of subfolders.

/virustotal <Filename>
Calculates the hash of the specified file and then opens it in VirusTotal
Web site.


/MD5 {0 | 1}
/SHA1 {0 | 1}
/CRC32 {0 | 1}
/SHA256 {0 | 1}
/SHA512 {0 | 1}
/SHA384 {0 | 1}
Allows you to turn on/off the specified hash type (0 = Turn Off, 1 = Turn
On). For example:
HashMyFiles.exe /MD5 1 /SHA1 1 /SHA256 0

/cfg <Filename>
Start HashMyFiles with the specified configuration file. For example:
HashMyFiles.exe /cfg "c:\config\hmf.cfg"
HashMyFiles.exe /cfg "%AppData%\HashMyFiles.cfg"

/stext <Filename>
Save the hashes list into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the hashes list into a tab-delimited text file.

/stabular <Filename>
Save the hashes list into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the hashes list into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the hashes list into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the hashes list to XML file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the hashes list to comma-delimited file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Filename" and "Identical". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~Identical") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put
multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.



/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

/SaveDirect
Save the hashes list in SaveDirect mode. For using with the other save
command-line options ( /scomma, /stab, /sxml, and so on...) When you use
the SaveDirect mode, the hash lines are saved directly to the disk,
without loading them into the memory first. This means that you can save
a list with large amount of hashes into your disk without any memory
problem, as long as you have enough disk space to store the saved file.
The drawback of this mode: You cannot sort the lines according to the
column you choose with /sort command-line option.

Examples:
HashMyFiles.exe /file "c:\temp\*.zip" /shtml "c:\temp\1.html"
HashMyFiles.exe /file "d:\temp\myfile.zip" /stab "d:\temp\myfile.txt"
HashMyFiles.exe /file "d:\my files"
HashMyFiles.exe /files "c:\temp\*.zip" "c:\temp\1234.exe"
"c:\temp\Hello.exe" /shtml "c:\temp\1.html"
HashMyFiles.exe /folder "c:\temp" /shtml "c:\temp\1.html"
HashMyFiles.exe /folder "c:\temp" /shtml "c:\temp\1.html" /sort
"Identical" /sort "Filename"
HashMyFiles.exe /folder "c:\temp" /shtml "c:\temp\1.html" /sort ~1
HashMyFiles.exe /wildcard "c:\temp\*.zip" 1 /shtml "c:\temp\1.html"
HashMyFiles.exe /SaveDirect /folder "c:\temp" /scomma "c:\temp\1.csv"



Translating HashMyFiles to other languages
==========================================

In order to translate HashMyFiles to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run HashMyFiles with /savelangfile parameter:
   HashMyFiles.exe /savelangfile
   A file named HashMyFiles_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   HashMyFiles utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run HashMyFiles, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run HashMyFiles without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
