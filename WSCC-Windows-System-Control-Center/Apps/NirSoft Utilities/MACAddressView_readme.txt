Description
===========

MACAddressView is a MAC address lookup tool that allows you to easily
find the company details (company name, address, and country) according
to the MAC address of a product.
MACAddressView also allows you to find MAC address records according to
the company name, company address, or country name. After finding the
desired MAC address records, you can save them into text/xml/HTML/csv
file or copy them to the clipboard and paste them into Excel or other
applications.

MACAddressView doesn't send any request to a remote server, it simply
uses the internal MAC addresses database stored inside the .exe file.

Using MACAddressView
====================

MACAddressView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply copy the executable file
(MACAddressView.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.

After running MACAddressView, the 'Find MAC Address Records' will appear.
By default, the 'Find By' option is set to 'MAC Address'. In this mode,
you can type one or more MAC Addresses, separated by space, comma, or
Enter key. You can try a full MAC address (like 01-02-03-04-05-06) or
only the first 3 bytes of the address (like 01-02-03). After typing all
MAC Addresses you need, click the 'Ok' button to view the details of all
MAC records that you asked.

You can also locate a MAC record according to the company name, company
address, or country name. You can look in the examples below to find out
what you can do with these options.



Examples of what you can find with MACAddressView
=================================================


* All MAC addresses range used by companies in Germany and Austria:
  Select 'Country Name' in 'Find By' combo-box, and then in the large
  text-box, type Germany and Austria, in 2 separated lines.
* All MAC addresses range used by Intel: Select 'Company Name' in 'Find
  By' combo-box, and then in the large text-box, type Intel.
* MAC addresses range used by companies in New York: Select 'Company
  Address' in 'Find By' combo-box, and then in the large text-box, type
  'New York'.



Using External File
===================

Although MACAddressView has an internal database inside the .exe file,
you can still use the latest MAC address lookup database available from
http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt. After downloading it, simply
put the 'oui.txt' filename in the same folder of MACAddressView.exe, and
run it.
When MACAddressView loads the data from external file, 'External File'
phrase will appear in the window title.



Command-Line Options
====================



/find <Find Type> <Find Text>
specifies the MAC addresses that you want to find. The <Find Type> should
be: 1 for searching by MAC addresses, 2 for searching by company name, 3
for searching by company address, or 4 for searching by country name. 5
for all MAC addresses. 6 for all MAC addresses on your computer.

/stext <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into a comma-delimited text file (csv).

/stabular <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the list of MAC Addresses into XML file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "MAC Addresses" and "Company". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Address") if you want to sort in descending order. You
can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.



/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

Examples:
MACAddressView.exe /find 1 "00-11-F5 00-21-4E 00-80-4C 00-C0-D6"
MACAddressView.exe /find 4 "italy"
MACAddressView.exe /find 4 "germany" /shtml c:\temp\maclist.html
MACAddressView.exe /find 2 "intel" /shtml c:\temp\maclist.html
MACAddressView.exe /find 4 "germany" /shtml c:\temp\maclist.html /sort
"Company"
MACAddressView.exe /Find 6 "" /scomma "c:\temp\mymacs.csv"



Translating MACAddressView to other languages
=============================================

In order to translate MACAddressView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run MACAddressView with /savelangfile parameter:
   MACAddressView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named MACAddressView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   MACAddressView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run MACAddressView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run MACAddressView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
