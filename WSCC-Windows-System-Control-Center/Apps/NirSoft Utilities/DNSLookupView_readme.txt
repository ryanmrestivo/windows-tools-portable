Description
===========

DNSLookupView is a DNS tracing tool for Windows 10 and Windows 11 that
allows you to view the details of every DNS query sent through the DNS
Client service of Windows. For every DNS query, the following information
is displayed: Host Name, Query Type (A, AAAA, and so on), Query Status
(Error or succeeded), Query Result, Query Timestamp, ID and name of the
process that requested the DNS lookup.



System Requirements
===================

This tool works only on Windows 11, Windows 10, and Windows 8.1. Both
32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. This tool doesn't work on older
versions of Windows, because the operating system doesn't support the DNS
tracing.



How it works ?
==============

This tool uses the event tracing of Windows operating system with the
'Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client' provider (
1C95126E-7EEA-49A9-A3FE-A378B03DDB4D ). The captured event ID is 3008,
which contains the information about every DNS query handled by the DNS
Client service of Windows.
