System Requirements And Limitations
===================================

  XP and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.
* The following Web browsers are supported: Internet Explorer, Mozilla
  Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Google Chrome.
* ImageCacheViewer won't work if you configure your Web browser to

Start Using ImageCacheViewer
============================

ImageCacheViewer doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
ImageCacheViewer.exe

After running ImageCacheViewer, it begins to scan the cache of your Web
browser, and displays all cached images from Web sites you visited in the
last day. If you want to get images from other days, you can remove or
change the last 1-day filter from the 'Advanced Options' window (F9).

After the scanning process is finished, you can also watch the image in
the lower pane of ImageCacheViewer, by selecting the desired item in the
upper pane.

If from some reason ImageCacheViewer fails to detect the cache of your
Web browser properly, you can go to 'Advanced Options' window (F9), and
choose the desired cache folders to scan for each Web browser.

   ImageCacheViewer utility.
