Description
===========

BatteryInfoView is a small utility for laptops and netbook computers that
displays the current status and information about your battery. The
displayed battery information includes the battery name, manufacture
name, serial number, manufacture date, power state
(charging/discharging), current battery capacity, full charged capacity,
voltage, charge/discharge rate, and more...
BatteryInfoView also provides a log window, which adds a new log line
containing the battery status every 30 seconds or any other time interval
that you choose.



System Requirements And Limitations
===================================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from windows
  2000 and up to Windows 11.
* Some information, like serial number and manufacture date is only
  displayed if the battery provides this information.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.26:
  o Added 'Sort Log On Every Update' option. When it's turned on,
    BatteryInfoView sorts the battery log every time that a new item is
    added.
  o Added 64-bit version.

* Version 1.25:
  o Updated the tray icon tooltip to display information of multiple
    batteries.

* Version 1.23:
  o Changed the 'Battery Wear Level' caption to 'Battery Health',
    which is the right term to use (Battery Wear Level is the opposite).

* Version 1.22:
  o Added option to display the battery capacity in mAh
    (milliampere-hour). This option works only if the voltage of the
    battery is available.

* Version 1.21:
  o Added 'Always On Top' option.
  o Fixed bug: BatteryInfoView failed to remember the last
    size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary
    monitor.

    Tray' option are turned on, the main window of BatteryInfoView will
    be invisible on start.

* Version 1.13:
  o Added thousands separator to the 'Charge/Discharge Rate' value.

* Version 1.12:
  o Added more options to control the event types added to the
    battery log. (In the 'Advanced Options' window)

* Version 1.11:
  o Added 'Mark Odd/Even Rows' option, under the View menu. When it's
    turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to
    make it easier to read a single line.

* Version 1.10:
  o Added command-line options for saving the battery information
    into a file.

* Version 1.05:
  o Added 'Battery Wear Level' field, which is calculated according
    to the Full Charged Capacity and Designed Capacity values of the
    battery.

* Version 1.00 - First release.



Using BatteryInfoView
=====================

BatteryInfoView doesn't require any installation process or additional
dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
BatteryInfoView.exe

The main window of BatteryInfoView provides 2 view modes:
* Battery Information: (Press F7 to switch into this mode)
  Displays general status and information about your battery. The
  information is updated every 10 seconds by default, and you change this
  update rate in the 'Advanced Options' window (F9). There are 4
  calculated fields that are updated only every 30 seconds or more.



* Battery Log: (Press F8 to switch into this mode)
  In this window, a new log containing the status of the battery (Power
  State, % Capacity, and so on) is added every 30 seconds. You can change
  the log interval in the 'Advanced Options' window (F9). A new log line
  is also added when the computer is suspended (standby/hibernate) and
  resumed, so you can easily find out in which rate the battery is
  discharged while the computer is on standby mode.




In both view modes, you can export the battery information into
csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file, by using the 'Save Selected Items'
option (Ctrl+S). You can also copy the information into the clipboard,
and then paste it into Excel or other spreadsheet application.
