Description
===========

WifiInfoView scans the wireless networks in your area and displays
extensive information about them, including: Network Name (SSID), MAC
Address, PHY Type (802.11g or 802.11n), RSSI, Signal Quality, Frequency,
Channel Number, Maximum Speed, Company Name, Router Model and Router Name
(Only for routers that provides this information), and more...
When you select a wireless network in the upper pane of this tool, the
lower pane displays the Wi-Fi information elements received from this
device, in hexadecimal format.
WifiInfoView also has a summary mode, which displays a summary of all
detected wireless networks, grouped by channel number, company that
manufactured the router, PHY type, or the maximum speed.



System Requirements
===================


* Operating System: This utility works on Windows Vista, Windows 7,
  Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows 10, and Windows 11. Both 32-bit
  and x64 systems are supported.
  Windows XP is not supported because this tool is based on new Wi-Fi API
  that doesn't exist on Windows XP. If you want to get wireless networks
  information on Windows XP, you can use the WirelessNetView utility.
* Wireless network adapter and wireless card driver that works with the
  built-in wireless support of Windows Vista/7/8/2008. If you don't have
  a compatible wireless adapter and driver, "cannot find wireless
  adapter" error will be displayed.
* In order to watch 5GHz wireless networks, you have to use a wireless
  network adapter that supports 5 GHz channels.
* Windows 11 24H2 Update - Starting from this Windows update, you must
  enable location access (Windows Settings > Privacy & security >
  Location) in order to allow the WifiInfoView tool to access wi-fi
  information. You have to enable the following options: 'Location
  services', 'Let apps access your location', 'Let desktop apps access
  your location'. If location access is not enabled properly, you'll see
  'Error 5: Access is denied' message in the bottom status bar.



Versions History
================


* Version 2.96:
  o Updated the internal MAC addresses file.

* Version 2.95:
  o When there is an error while trying to scan the wireless
    networks, WifiInfoView displays error code and error message in the
    bottom status bar (in red color).
  o If you get 'Error 5: Access is denied' message on Windows 11
    24H2, you must enable the location services properly, see the 'System
    Requirements' section for more information.

Start Using WifiInfoView
========================

WifiInfoView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
WifiInfoView.exe

After you run WifiInfoView, the list of detected wireless networks in
your area is displayed on the upper pane and it's updated at very high
rate. You can change update rate from Options->Update Rate menu.
When you select one or more wireless networks in the upper pane, the
lower pane displays the Wi-Fi information elements of the selected items,
in hexadecimal format.



Columns In the Upper Pane
=========================


* SSID: The name of the network.
* MAC Address: MAC address of the router.
* PHY Type: The PHY type for this network - 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n,
  or High-Rate DSSS
* RSSI: The received signal strength indicator value, in units of
  decibels referenced to 1.0 milliwatts (dBm), as detected by the
  wireless LAN interface driver for the AP or peer station.
* Signal Quality: A number between 0 and 100 that represents the
  quality of the signal.
* Frequency: The channel center frequency of the band on which the
  802.11 Beacon or Probe Response frame was received. The value of this
  column is in units of Gigahertz (GHz).
* Channel: Channel number used by this wireless network.
* Information Size:The total size (in bytes) of all Wi-Fi information
  elements received from this wireless network.
* Elements Count: The total number of Wi-Fi information elements
  received from this wireless network.
* Company: The company that manufactured the router, according to the 3
  first bytes of the MAC address.
* Router Model: The model of the router. This value is displayed only
  for routers that provide this information inside the Wi-Fi information
  elements.
* Router Name: The name of the router. This value is displayed only for
  routers that provide this information inside the Wi-Fi information
  elements.
* Security: Specifies whether the network is secured (Yes/No).
* Maximum Speed: The maximum speed (in Mbps) that you can get when
  connecting to this wireless network.
* First Detection: The first date/time that this network was detected.
* Last Detection: The last date/time that this network was detected.
* Detection Count: The number of times that this network was detected.



Summary Modes
=============

When you switch to one of the summary modes, instead of showing the list
of all networks, WifiInfoView only shows the number of networks and the
average/minimum/maximum of the signal quality for every group.


For example, in the above screenshot, you can see that there are 25
wireless networks that use channel 6, 10 wireless networks that use
channel 11, and so on....

In the example below, you can see the there are 9 wireless routers of
NETGEAR, 8 wireless routers of Sagemcom, and so on... (Be aware that some
companies may appear more than once, with a little different name)


The following summary modes are available under the Options menu:
Channels Summary Mode, Companies Summary Mode, PHY Types Summary Mode,
and Max Speed Summary Mode



The 'Company' Column
====================

WifiInfoView allows you to view the company name of each wireless device.
The company name is determined according to the MAC address.

By default, WifiInfoView uses an internal database of MAC
addresses/companies which is updated from time to time. If you want to
use the most updated database, you can download it from the following
link, and put in the same folder of WifiInfoView.exe:
http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt
Be aware that you must save it as 'oui.txt'



Connect Selected Access Point
=============================

The 'Connect Selected Access Point' option (F2) allows you to connect to
the desired access point from the main window of WifiInfoView. This
feature is especially useful if you have multiple access points with the
same name, because WifiInfoView allows you choose the access point to
connect. , as opposed to the default wifi manager of Windows, which makes
the connection according to the network name.



Export to .pcap file
====================

Starting from version 2.90, you can export the access points information
to .pcap file by using the 'Export Selected Items To .pcap file' option
(Ctrl+E), and then open and analyze the generated .pcap file with the
Wireshark software.
When you use this option, a single beacon frame with all information
elements is added to the .pcap file for every access point that you
select.

Here's an example for .pcap file generated by WifiInfoView, and then
opened in Wireshark:




Using WifiInfoView With GetNir Tool
===================================

You can use WifiInfoView together with GetNir tool to extract specific
value from WifiInfoView.
Here's some example:
* Get the RSSI of 'MyNet' access point and send it to stdout:
  WifiInfoView.exe /stab "" | GetNir "RSSI" "SSID=MyNet"
* Get the RSSI of access point that its BSSID is 01-02-03-04-05-06 and
  store it in rssi.txt :
  WifiInfoView.exe /stab "" | GetNir "RSSI"
  "MACAddress=01-02-03-04-05-06" > rssi.txt
* Get the list of access points on channel 48, and send the result to
  stdout:
  WifiInfoView.exe /stab "" | GetNir "SSID" "Channel=48"
* Get the name, BSSID, and RSSI of the access point you are connected
  to, and send the result to stdout:
  WifiInfoView.exe /stab "" | GetNir "SSID,MACAddress,RSSI"
  "Connected=Yes"



Command-Line Options
====================
