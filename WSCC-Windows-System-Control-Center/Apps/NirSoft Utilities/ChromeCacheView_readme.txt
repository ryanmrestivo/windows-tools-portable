Description
===========

ChromeCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Google
Chrome Web browser, and displays the list of all files currently stored
in the cache. For each cache file, the following information is
displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last accessed time, Expiration
time, Server name, Server response, and more.
You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then
extract the files to another folder, or copy the URLs list to the
clipboard.



The Location Of Chrome Cache Folder
===================================

The cache folder of Google Chrome is located under [User Profile]\Local
Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000, and up to Windows 7/8/2008/10/11.



Using ChromeCacheView
=====================

ChromeCacheView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. Simply copy the executable file (ChromeCacheView.exe) to any
folder you like, and run it.
After you run it, the main window displays the list of files currently
stored in the cache of the default Google Chrome user.
You can select one or more cache files from the list, and then export the
list into text/html/xml file ('Save Selected Items' option), copy the URL
list to the clipboard (Ctrl+U), copy the entire table of cache files
(Ctrl+C), and then paste it to Excel or to OpenOffice spreadsheet. You
can also extract the actual files from the cache, and save them into
another folder, You can do that by using the 'Copy Selected Cache Files
To' option (F4).

Starting from version 2.10 - When you select image cache item ( gif, png,
jpg) or text-based cache item (HTML, CSS, JSON, Javascript), you can
watch the content of the cache file in the lower pane if the 'Show
Preview Pane' option is turned on (View -> Show Preview Pane or simply
press F8).
