Description
===========

This utility is a GUI alternative to the NSLookup tool that comes with
Windows operating system. It allows you to easily retrieve the DNS
records (MX, NS, A, SOA) of the specified domains. You can use the
default DNS server of your Internet connection, or use any other DNS
server that you specify. After retrieving the DNS records for the desired
domains, you can save them into text/xml/html/csv file.



System Requirements
===================

DNSDataView can work on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista,
Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows 11.
Older versions of Windows are not supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.76:
  o Added new option to the 'DNS Record Types' section: DMARC. When
    you select this option, DNSDataView automatically adds the correct
    host name to the domain ( _dmarc) in order to get this record.

* Version 1.75:
  o Added 'Load domains from file' option, which allows you to load
    the domains list from a text file, instead of pasting the domains
    into the text-box.

* Version 1.71:
  o Fixed the refresh option to work properly when using the 'Load
    Windows DNS Cache' option.

* Version 1.70:
  o Added new option: 'Get A record of every host name in PTR records'

* Version 1.65:
  o Added /DomainsFile command-line option, which allows you to load
    the domains list from a file, for example:
    DNSDataView.exe /DomainsFile "c:\temp\domains-list.txt" /scomma
    "c:\temp\domains-result.csv"

* Version 1.61:
  o Fixed bug: DNSDataView failed to work properly with IDN domains
    (Internationalized domain name) of some european languages.

* Version 1.60:
  o Added 'TTL' column.

* Version 1.56:
  o Added /cfg command-line option to start DNSDataView with the
    specified config file.

* Version 1.55:
  o You can now specify any variable inside DNSDataView.cfg as
    command-line option in order to modify the settings of DNSDataView,
    for example:
    DNSDataView.exe /NSRecords 1 /ARecords 1 /AAAARecords 1 /TEXTRecords 0

* Version 1.50:
  o Added command-line options to export the result directly into a
    file without any user interface, for example:
    DNSDataView.exe /Domains "yahoo.com google.com" /scomma
    c:\temp\dns.csv

* Version 1.46:
  o Fixed the domains text-box in 'Select Domains' window to handle
    Ctrl+A (Select All).

* Version 1.45:
  o Added 'Automatically extract domains from URL' option. When it's
    turned on, you can enter a URL of a Web site, and DNSDataView will
    automatically extract the domain from the URL.

* Version 1.43:
  o Fixed bug: When DNSDataView received multiple strings of TEXT DNS
    records, it displayed only the first one...

* Version 1.42:
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.

* Version 1.41:
  o Fixed the resizing problems of the 'Select Domains' window - some
    fields remained in their position instead of moving.
  o DNSDataView now remembers that last size and position of the
    'Select Domains' window.
  o Fixed the tab order of the 'Select Domains' window.

* Version 1.40:
  o Added 'Clear Windows DNS Cache' option, which allows you to
    easily clear the dns cache of Windows.

    all DNS records stored in the DNS cache of Windows.

* Version 1.31:
  o Fixed DNSDataView to work also on Windows 2000.

* Version 1.30:
  o Added 'Get a PTR record for every IP address' option. When it's
    turned on, DNSDataView retrieves the PTR records of every IP address
    found in the other records.

* Version 1.26:
  o When host name doesn't have IPv4 address, DNSDataView now
    retrieves its IPv6 address.

* Version 1.25:
  o Added support for reverse DNS lookup (PTR records). You can now
    type a valid IP address instead of domain name, and DNSDataView will
    automatically make a reverse DNS lookup for the specified IP address,
    by sending the right PTR request.

  o Added 'Section' column which displays Answer or Additional.
  o Added option to fileter out additional records.
  o Fixed the resize problem of the SRV check box.

    error number and message for every DNS record that cannot be
    retrieved.

  o Added support for AAAA records (IPv6). This feature might not
    work on Windows XP without installed service packs.

    when the 'NS' option was selected too.

* Versions 1.02:

their DNS information, and click 'Ok'. After very short time, you should
get all DNS records of the specified domains in the main window of
DNSDataView.
If DNSDataView fails to retrieve the DNS records, you should try to
manually type the DNS server of your Internet provider.

/ARecords <0 | 1>
/AAAARecords <0 | 1>
/CNAMERecords <0 | 1>

option in order to modify the settings of DNSDataView, for example:
DNSDataView.exe /MXRecords 0 /ARecords 1 /AAAARecords 1 /SOARecords 0

Example:
DNSDataView.exe /Domains "yahoo.com google.com" /scomma c:\temp\dns.csv



Translating DNSDataView to other languages
==========================================

In order to translate DNSDataView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run DNSDataView with /savelangfile parameter:
   DNSDataView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named DNSDataView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   DNSDataView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run DNSDataView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run DNSDataView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
