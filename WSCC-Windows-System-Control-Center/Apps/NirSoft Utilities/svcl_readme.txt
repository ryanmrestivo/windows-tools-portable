The /Stdout command-line option
===============================

By default, when you use a command to get the current sound volume or
mute state, the value is returned through the return code of the .exe
file and you can get it with the %errorlevel% variable, for example:
svcl.exe /GetPercent "Realtek High Definition
Audio\Device\Speakers\Render"
echo %errorlevel%

With svcl.exe, there is another option, you can add the /Stdout command,
and then the value will be send to stdout and it'll be displayed inside
your command prompt window, for example:
svcl.exe /Stdout /GetPercent "Realtek High Definition
Audio\Device\Speakers\Render"

If you add the /Stdout command to a set command ( /SetVolume, /SetDefault
, /Mute , /ChangeVolume , and others....) , the list of the found sound
items will be sent to Stdout, so you can see which sound items are
affected by the executed command.
