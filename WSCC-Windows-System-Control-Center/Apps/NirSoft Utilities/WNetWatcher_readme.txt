Description
===========

Wireless Network Watcher is a small utility that scans your wireless
network and displays the list of all computers and devices that are
currently connected to your network.
For every computer or device that is connected to your network, the
following information is displayed: IP address, MAC address, the company
that manufactured the network card, and optionally the computer name.
You can also export the connected devices list into html/xml/csv/text
file, or copy the list to the clipboard and then paste into Excel or
other spreadsheet application.



System Requirements And Limitations
===================================


* This utility works on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server
  2003/2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows
  11.
* This utility can only scan a wireless network that you're currently
  connected to. It cannot scan other wireless networks.
* In rare cases, it's possible that Wireless Network Watcher won't
  detect the correct wireless network adapter, and then you should go to
  'Advanced Options' window (F9), and manually choose the correct network
  adapter.
* although this utility is officially designed for wireless networks,
  you can also use it to scan a small wired network.

    is turned on.

* Version 1.46
  o Added 'Clear ARP Cache On Every Scan' option. This option is
    useful for Windows 2000/XP, because if the ARP cache is not cleared,
    a device might be displayed as connected even when it's not
    connected, because the ARP information is taken from the cache of
    Windows operating system. On Windows Vista/7, this option is
    irrelevant, because the ARP scanning is not affected by the cache.

  o Added 'Device Options' window (Ctrl+F9), which allows you to
    change the beep/tray balloon configuration for every device
    separately.

* Version 1.42

    beep/tray balloon alert only if the device is detected in the first
    time'. If you turn on this option, you'll get a beep/tray balloon
    alert only if the device has not been detected before (Detection
    Count = 1).

* Version 1.41
  o The tooltip of the tray icon now shows the number of connected
    devices.

* Version 1.40
  o Added option to choose audio file to play when a new device is
    detected (In Advanced Options), instead of using the default beep
    sound of Windows.
  o Added 'Start As Hidden' option. When this option and 'Put Icon On
    Tray' option are turned on, the main window of Wireless Network
    Watcher will be invisible on start.

* Version 1.35

* Version 1.31
  o Fixed the sorting of the IP Address column.

* Version 1.30
  o Added command-line options to scan your network and save the
    result into text/html/xml file, without displaying any user interface.

* Version 1.27
  o Added 'Automatically Copy Device Name To User Text' option. When
    it's turn on, the user text of new device is automatically filled
    with the name of the device.

* Version 1.26
  o Added 'Scan On Program Start' option. You can turn off this
    option if you don't want that Wireless Network Watcher will start
    scanning automatically when you run it.

* Version 1.25
  o Added option to choose the desired IP addresses range to scan.
    (In the 'Advanced Options' window)

* Version 1.20
  o Added 'Put Icon On Tray' option. When it's turned on, icon of
    Wireless Network Watcher is added to the system tray of Windows.
  o Added 'Tray Balloon On New Device' option. If it's turned on,
    Wireless Network Watcher displays a tray balloon when a new device is
    detected.

* Version 1.15
  o Added 'Background Scan', under the Options menu. When this option
    is turned on, Wireless Network Watcher make a continuous background
    scan to automatically discover new devices or computers that
    connected the network, without activating the scan again. The
    background scan is slower and less intensive then the regular scan,
    so it won't overload your computer.
  o Added 'Beep On New Device' option. When the background scan is
    turned on, you can use this option to get a 'beep' sound when a new
    device is detected.

* Version 1.10
  o Added 'User Text' column, which allows to enter your own text for
    a specific computer/device, from the Properties window (Alt+Enter).
    The text that you write will be displayed for the same device in
    future scans. (The devices information is stored in the .cfg file of
    Wireless Network Watcher)
  o Wireless Network Watcher now displays the first date/time that
    the specified device was found, and the number of times that the
    device was detected. (The information is saved in the .cfg file)
  o When there are multiple IP address blocks on a single network
    card, Wireless Network Watcher now scans all of them (In previous
    versions, it scanned only the first IP addresses block)
  o Fixed bug: In previous version, Wireless Network Watcher randomly
    skipped some devices after the scanning the first 64 IP addresses.

* Version 1.05
  o Fixed Wireless Network Watcher to scan the entire network when
    the subnet mask is not 255.255.255.0, for example, if the subnet mask
    is 255.255.254.0, Wireless Network Watcher will scan 512 addresses.
    For now, it's limited for up to 4096 IP addresses, to avoid from very
    long scanning.
  o Improved the scanning on slow computers or slow networks.

* Version 1.00 - First release.



Using Wireless Network Watcher
==============================

Wireless Network Watcher doesn't require any installation process or
additional dll files. In order to start using it, simply extract the
executable file (WNetWatcher.exe) from the zip file, and run it.
If you want, you can also download WNetWatcher with full
install/uninstall support (wnetwatcher_setup.exe), so a shortcut for
running WNetWatcher will be automatically added into your start menu.

After running WNetWatcher, it automatically locates your wireless
adapter, and scans your network. After a few seconds, you should start
see the list of computers that are currently connected to your network.

If from some reason, WNetWatcher failed to locate and scan your network,
you can try to manually choosing the correct network adapter, by pressing
F9 (Advanced Options) and choosing the right network adapter.



Columns Description
===================


* IP Address: IP Address of the device or computer.
* Device Name: The name of the device or computer. This field may
  remain empty if the computer or the device doesn't provide its name.
* MAC Address: The MAC address of the network adapter.
* Network Adapter Company: The company that manufactured the network
  adapter, according to the MAC Address. This column can help you to
  detect the type of the device or computer. For example, if the company
  name is Apple, the device is probably a Mac computer, iPhone, or iPad.
  if the company name is Nokia, the device is probably a cellular phone
  of Nokia.

  By default, this utility uses an internal MAC addresses database stored
  inside the .exe file, but it's not always updated with the latest MAC
  address assignments.
  You can manually download the latest MAC addresses file from
  http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt and then put oui.txt in the
  same folder where WNetWatcher.exe is located. When you run
  WNetWatcher.exe, it'll automatically load and use the external oui.txt
  instead of the internal MAC addresses database.
* Device Information: This column displays 'Your Computer' if the
  device is the computer that you currently use. This column displays
  'Your Router' if the device is the wireless router.
* User Text: You can assign your own text to any device detected by
  WNetWatcher. By default, this field is filled with the device name. In
  order to change the User Text, simply double-click the item and type
  the desired text.
* Active: Specifies whether this device is currently active. When a
  device is not detected anymore, the 'Active' value is turned from 'Yes'
  to 'No'
* Detection Count: Number of times that this device was detected on
  your network. Every time that a network scan is running and the device
  is detected, this value is increased by one.
* First Detected On: The first time that this device was detected.
* Last Detected On: The last time that this device was detected.



Background Scan
===============

Starting from version 1.15, there is a new option under the Options menu
- 'Background Scan'.
When it's turned on, Wireless Network Watcher first make the regular fast
network scan to discover all current connected devices. After that, a
continuous background scan is activated to discover when new devices are
connected to your network. The background scan is slower and less
intensive then the regular scan, so it won't overload your computer and
you can leave it to run in the background while using other programs.
When the background scan is running, a counter of the scan process is
displayed in the second section of the bottom status bar.

When the background scan is used, you can use the 'Beep On New Device'
option to get a beep sound when a new device is detected.



Custom Context Menu
===================

Starting from version 2.30, you can add your own custom menu items into
the context menu of Wireless Network Watcher.
In order to do this, you have to exit completely from Wireless Network
Watcher and then edit the WNetWatcher.cfg file, located in the same
folder of WNetWatcher.exe. You can edit WNetWatcher.cfg with notepad or
any other text editor.

The structure of the custom menu configuration is very simple, and looks
like this:


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Menu Caption
Command0=Menu Command
Caption1=Menu Caption
Command1=Menu Command
Caption2=Menu Caption
Command2=Menu Command
.
.
.



You can create up to 10 different menu items (from 0 to 9). The command
string is an executable file with parameters that provide the information
about the selected items.
For example, the following menu item will ping the selected IP address in
a command-prompt window:


[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Ping This IP address
Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %IPAddress%


Wireless Network Watcher will replace the %IPAddress% variable with the
IP address of the selected device. You can use the following variables
for the custom menu command (They are identical to the column names, but
without the space characters): %IPAddress% %DeviceName% %MACAddress%
%NetworkAdapterCompany% %DeviceInformation% %UserText% %FirstDetectedOn%
%LastDetectedOn% %DetectionCount% %Active%

Finally, here's an example for full custom menu items. Notice that
Caption3 and Caption6 are actually a menu separator. Also, Command7 is a
'ShellExecute' command, which means that instead of specifying .exe file,
you specify a file, URL, or network resource to open (In this case it's
Admin share of the remote computer).

[CustomMenu]
Caption0=Ping IP address
Command0=cmd.exe /K ping %IPAddress%
Caption1=Ping Host Name
Command1=cmd.exe /K ping %DeviceName%
Caption2=Check IP Address With Nbtstat
Command2=cmd.exe /K nbtstat.exe -A %IPAddress%
Caption3=-
Caption4=Open IP Address In Chrome
Command4=chrome.exe %IPAddress%
Caption5=Open IP Address In Firefox
Command5=Firefox.exe %IPAddress%
Caption6=-
Caption7=Open Admin Share
Command7=ShellExecute:\\%IPAddress%\Admin$


The custom menu of the above example looks like this:




Command-Line Options
====================



/cfg <Filename>
Start Wireless Network Watcher with the specified configuration file. For
example:
WNetWatcher.exe /cfg "c:\config\wnw.cfg"
WNetWatcher.exe /cfg "%AppData%\WNetWatcher.cfg"

/stext <Filename>
Scan your network, and save the network devices list into a regular text
file.

Translating Wireless Network Watcher to other languages
=======================================================

In order to translate Wireless Network Watcher to other language, follow
the instructions below:
1. Run Wireless Network Watcher with /savelangfile parameter:
   WNetWatcher.exe /savelangfile
   A file named WNetWatcher_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   WNetWatcher utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run WNetWatcher, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run WNetWatcher without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
