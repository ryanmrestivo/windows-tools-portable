Description
===========

ManageWirelessNetworks is an alternative tool to the standard 'Manage
Wireless Networks' of Windows (or 'Manage Known Networks' on Windows 10).
It displays extensive information about every wireless profile on your
system, even if the network adapter is not active. For every wireless
profile, the following information is displayed: Profile Name, SSID,
Connection Type, Connection Mode, Authentication, Encryption, Key Type,
Auto Switch (Yes/No), Non Broadcast (Yes/No), Profile Position, Created
Time, Modified Time, Wireless Key, and more...

ManageWirelessNetworks also allows you to edit a single profile with the
standard editor of Windows, edit the XML of the wireless profile (For
advanced users only !), quickly switch between manual and automatic mode,
quickly switch between WPAPSK/WPA2PSK/AES/TKIP modes, rename the profile,
rename the SSID, move profile position up and down, copy multiple
wireless profiles to another wireless card on your system, and more...

Start Using ManageWirelessNetworks
==================================

ManageWirelessNetworks doesn't require any installation process or
additional DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the
executable file - ManageWirelessNetworks.exe
After you run the ManageWirelessNetworks tool, the main window displays
the details of all wireless profiles on your system. You can select one
or more profiles from the list and then choose the desired action from
the top menu or from the right-click context menu.

Be aware: ManageWirelessNetworks displays all wireless profiles on your
system, even if the wireless adapter is not active. However, most actions
(like edit profile, rename SSID, and so on...) only works for wireless
profiles with active network adapter. If you want to view only the
wireless profiles that their wireless adapter is active, simply turn on
the 'Load Only Active Network Interfaces' option.
Wireless profiles of active network adapters are displayed with green
icon, while Wireless profiles of inactive network adapters are displayed
with gray icon.



Export wireless profiles list
=============================

In order to export the wireless profiles list into a file, simply select
one or more files in the main window (or press Ctrl+A to select all
items), press Ctrl+S (Save Selected Items) and then in the save
dialog-box choose the type of file to export (Text File, Tab Delimited
Text File, JSON File, HTML File - Horizontal, HTML File - Vertical, XML
File, or Comma Delimited Text File), type the filename to save, and then
click the Save button.

Optionally, you can also press Ctrl+C (Copy Selected Items) to copy the
wireless profiles list as tab-delimited format, and then paste the
profiles list into Excel or other spreadsheet application.



Copy wireless profiles to another wireless network adapter
==========================================================

If you have a new wireless network adapter and you want to connect the
same wireless networks that you used with another network adapter, simply
select the profiles you want to use with the new adapter, choose the
'Copy Profiles To Another Network Interface' option from the File menu,
select your new wireless adapter, and ManageWirelessNetworks tool will
copy all previous profiles to the new adapter. This feature works even if
the previous network adapter is not active.



Rename SSID
===========

If you changed the name of your wireless network (SSID), you can easily
update the new SSID by using the 'Rename SSID' option. Only the SSID of
your profile will be updated. All other settings, like the network key,
will remain the same as before. Optionally, you can also update the
profile name by using the 'Rename Profile' option.



Edit Wireless Profile
=====================

The 'Edit Wireless Profile' option allows you the change the settings of
existing wireless profile, using the standard wireless profile editor of
Windows operating system. Be aware that this option works only for
wireless profiles of active network adapter (Active Interface = Yes).



Delete wireless profiles
========================

ManageWirelessNetworks allows you to delete one or more wireless profiles
on your system, by using the 'Delete Selected Profiles' option
(Ctrl+Delete). If you want to delete wireless profiles of inactive
wireless adapter (Active Interface = No), you have to run
ManageWirelessNetworks as Administrator (Ctrl+F11).



Duplicate Profile
=================

If you want to duplicate an existing wireless profile on the same
wireless network adapter, simply select the desired profile, choose
'Duplicate Profile' from the menu, type the name of the new duplicated
profile and then ManageWirelessNetworks will create a new profile with
exactly the same settings of the original profile. After the duplicated
profile is created, you can use the 'Edit Wireless Profile' and other
options to change the settings of the duplicated profile.



Set connection mode for multiple profiles
=========================================

ManageWirelessNetworks allows you to quickly choose the wireless profiles
that Windows will try to connect automatically. Simply select the desired
wireless profiles, and then press F7 to connect the selected wireless
profiles automatically (Set Connection Mode -> Automatic), or press F8 to
stop connecting the selected wireless profiles automatically (Set
Connection Mode -> Manual).



View Wireless Keys
==================

If you want the view the wireless key of your wireless profiles, go to
the Options menu and turn on the 'Show Wireless Keys' options.
ManageWirelessNetworks displays the wireless key only for profiles of
active wireless adapter (Active Interface = Yes).
Be aware that on systems prior to Windows 10 you have to run
ManageWirelessNetworks as Administrator (Ctrl+F11) in order to view the
wireless keys.
