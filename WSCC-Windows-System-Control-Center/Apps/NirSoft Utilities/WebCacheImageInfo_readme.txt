Description
===========

WebCacheImageInfo is a simple tool that searches for JPEG images with
EXIF information stored inside the cache of your Web browser (Internet
Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome), and then it displays the list of all
images found in the cache with the interesting information stored in
them, like the software that was used to create the image, the camera
model that was used to photograph the image, and the date/time that the
image was created.



System Requirements And Limitations
===================================


* This utility works in any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  XP and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.
* The following Web browsers are supported: Internet Explorer, Mozilla
  Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Google Chrome. Opera is not supported because
  it stores the JPEG images in Webp format.
* WebCacheImageInfo won't work if you configure your Web browser to
  clear the cache after closing it.
* It's recommended to close all windows of your Web browser before
  using WebCacheImageInfo, to ensure that all cache files are saved to

  information stored in them. It doesn't display other images stored in
  the cache of your Web browsers.

Start Using WebCacheImageInfo
=============================

WebCacheImageInfo doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
WebCacheImageInfo.exe

After running it, WebCacheImageInfo begins to scan the cache of your Web
browser and displays every JPEG image with EXIF information found inside
the cache. You may need to wait up to a few minutes until the scanning
process is finished. After the scanning process is finished, you can also
watch the image in the lower pane of WebCacheImageInfo, by selecting the
desired item in the upper pane.

If from some reason WebCacheImageInfo fails to detect the cache of your
Web browser properly, you can go to 'Advanced Options' window (F9), and
choose the desired cache folders to scan for each Web browser.



Columns Description
===================


* URL: The URL of the image.
* Web Browser: The Web browser that stores the specified image file in
  the cache.
* Image Software: The software that was used to create or to modify the
  specified image.
